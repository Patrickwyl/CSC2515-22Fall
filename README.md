# CSC2515-22Fall
school work of CSC2515H1 F (Fall) Introduction to Machine Learning \
https://web.cs.toronto.edu/graduate/course-descriptions
## Course Description:
Machine learning (ML) is a set of techniques that allow computers to learn from data and experience, rather than requiring humans to specify the desired behaviour manually. This course introduces the main concepts and ideas in ML, and provides an overview of many commonly used machine learning algorithms. It also serves as a foundation for more advanced ML courses.

The students will learn about ML problems (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning), models (linear and nonlinear, including neural networks), loss functions (squared error, cross entropy, hinge, exponential), bias and variance tradeoff, ensemble methods (bagging and boosting), optimization techniques in ML, probabilistic viewpoint of ML, etc.

Prerequisite: This is a relatively math-heavy course. The students need to be comfortable with the following topics: Probability Theory, Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Programming (preferably in Python).
